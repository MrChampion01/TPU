Here's a revised version of your README to make it look nicer:

# TPU

TPU, The Test Processing Unit, or Terrible Processing Unit, is a simple 16-bit CPU written in VHDL. It serves as an educational tool to demonstrate the dataflow within a CPU and is designed to run on the miniSpartan6+.

**Note:** Some code in the `vhdl/top` and `vhdl/dvid` directories is not owned by me. Please refer to those files for more information.

The original implementation is described in detail at [Domipheus Labs](http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/category/projects/tpu/).

All credit goes to Domipheus for the idea and project. This fork is for me to follow along and make updates as I progress through each part.

**Currently on Part 8:** [Designing a CPU in VHDL - Part 8: Revisiting the ISA, Function Calling, Assembler](https://domipheus.com/blog/designing-a-cpu-in-vhdl-part-8-revisiting-the-isa-function-calling-assembler/)
